        <p>Environment Diagrams are a visual tool to keep track of bindings and
state of a computer program. In this class, we use Python as our
primary language, but the diagrams we teach can be applied to similar
languages.</p>

<h2>Preface: a defense</h2>
Every semester, lots of students ask why we teach environment
diagrams. The simple answer is we think environment diagrams help
students learn the evaluation process of a computer program.

<p>However, this usually isn't a satisfactory explanation, so here is an
attempt to address the more nuanced concerns of former (and current)
students.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the answers provided are my own (Albert), and do not
necessarily reflect the views of the rest of the teaching staff.

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Environment diagrams are too conceptual/not practical.</strong></p>
  
  <p>61A (and Computer Science in general) is not just about writing code
  -- it's about understanding <em>why</em> things work the way they do.
  Environment diagrams are very conceptual, but that fits into the
  goal of this course.</p>
  
  <p>As for practicallity, I admit that environment diagrams are more of
  a learning tool. They don't scale well to large programs.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>This is a CS class. Why are we drawing things?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Environment diagrams provide a way to visualize the state of a
  program. I've found that having a physical diagram to look at helps
  students learn faster than having them stare at lines of code.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Environment diagrams are non-intuitive.</strong></p>
  
  <p>There might be two reasons why you find them difficult:
  
  <ol>
    <li>You can't remember all the rules. If that's the case, just keep
    practicing and practicing. Also, keep in mind that these rules
    aren't arbitrary -- they reflect what a computer actually does.
    Each rule exists for a reason.</li>
    <li>You expect the program to behave differently than the diagram. In
    that case, you should take the time to really understand why each
    step occurs.</li>
  </ol></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>I can understand programs just fine. Why do I have to learn
  environment diagrams?</strong></p>
  
  <p>From a logistical perspective, the teaching staff needs a way to
  gauge how well students are learning. Having a uniform "system"
  makes it easier for us to do this.</p>
  
  <p>I understand that some students can "run the code in their head" and
  get the correct output. Unfortunately, on a test, by simply asking
  students to write the final output of a program, it is more likely
  that students will be able to guess the answer. That defeats the
  purppose of the exam, which is to see how well students understand
  the material, not how well they can guess.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Environment diagrams on exams are too difficult.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Sorry. We'll try to keep the tricks to a minimum.</p>
  
  <p>I agree that no sane programmer would write code as confusing as our
  exam questions. That being said, my opinion is if you can
  successfully evaluate something that complicated, you'll be able to
  handle anything you see in the real world.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>I hate environment diagrams.</strong></p>
  
  <p>:(</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
Environment diagrams are designed to keep track of name bindings. In
other words, it acts as a sort of bookkeeping device: if you (or the
interpreter) wants to know what value is bound to a variable called
<code>foo</code>, an environment diagram will help you do that.

<p>As programs grow more complex (with higher-order functions, nonlocal
state, etc.), environment diagrams are designed to provide a
systematic way to keep track of otherwise unclear effects.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<h3>Frames</h3>

<p>A <strong>frame</strong> keeps track of variable-to-value bindings. Every function
call keeps track of its own set of bindings (e.g. it has its own
<strong>scope</strong>), so every <em>function call</em> has a corresponding frame.</p>

<p>The <strong>global frame</strong>, or "Global" for short, is the starting frame.
Global doesn't correspond to a specific function</p>

<p>Every frame except for Global has a <strong>parent frame</strong>. When function is
called, its corresponding frame immediately has a parent -- that
parent is the <em>frame in which that function was defined</em>. When doing
variable lookup, if you can't find a variable in the current frame,
you look in its parent.</p>

<p>Frames might also have <strong>frame numbers</strong>. These numbers are used to
label frames that are parents. If a frame is never a parent, it
doesn't have to have a number.</p>

<h3>Variables versus Values</h3>

<p>A <strong>variable</strong> (or a <strong>name</strong>) is distinct from the <strong>value</strong> to which
it is assigned. For example, consider the following simple assignment:</p>

<pre><code>x = 3</code></pre>

<p>The variable is <code>x</code>, and the value is <code>3</code>. Think of a variable as a
box with a label, and the value is the thing you put inside the box.</p>

<p>This distinction becomes especially important when it comes to
functions. Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>def square(x):
    return x*x</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the variable is <code>square</code>, and the value is <em>a function
object</em>. Remember, in Python, functions are objects just like
everything else, so they are distinct from the variable to which they
are bound.</p>

<h3>Arrows/Pointers</h3>

<p>In some bindings, we draw <strong>arrows</strong> (or <strong>pointers</strong>) from the
variable to the value. This isn't just an arbitrary aesthetic design.
A pointer represents a <em>reference</em> to a value. We'll talk more about
this later.</p>

<h2>Drawing diagrams</h2>
We'll be using the following code example for this section:

<pre><code>x = 3
y = 1 + 2 + 3

def square(x):
    return x*x

square(y)</code></pre>

<h3>Global Frame</h3>

<p>Always start by drawing the Global frame. This occurs before any of
the code is executed (e.g. before <code>x = 3</code> is executed).</p>

<h3>Bindings</h3>

<p>We draw <strong>bindings</strong> when one of the following occurs:

<ul>
  <li>variable assignment</li>
  <li><code>def</code> statement</li>
  <li><code>import</code> statement</li>
</ul></p>

<p>There's a simple three-step process for drawing bindings:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Evaluate the value</strong> of the binding</li>
  <li>In the current frame, <strong>draw a small box with the value</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Write the variable</strong> to the left of the box</li>
</ol></p>

<p>There is one small detail for the second step: if the value is a
<strong>primitive</strong>, we put it <em>in</em> the box; otherwise, we draw an arrow to
the object. Here are some examples of primitives and non-primitives:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Primitives</strong> (draw <em>in</em> box):
  
  <ul>
    <li>numbers (<code>42</code>, <code>3.14</code>)</li>
    <li>booleans (<code>True</code>, <code>False</code>)</li>
    <li>Strings (<code>&quot;hello world!&quot;</code>)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Non-primitives</strong> (draw arrow):
  
  <ul>
    <li>functions (<code>def square(x): ...</code>, <code>lambda x: x*x</code>)</li>
    <li>tuples and lists (<code>(1, 2, 3)</code>, <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>)</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul></p>

<p>Let's walk through the example. The first line is a variable
assignment:</p>

<pre><code>x = 3</code></pre>

<p>where <code>x</code> is the variable and <code>3</code> is the value.</p>

<p><img src="public/img/environments/x-equals-3.png" alt="x = 3"></p>

<p>The second line is a little more involved. There is a complex
expression on the right-hand side of the <code>=</code>, so we must <em>evaluate</em> it
first. Notice in the following diagram that <code>y</code> is bound to <code>6</code>, not
<code>1 + 2 + 3</code>:</p>

<p><img src="public/img/environments/y-equals-6.png" alt="y = 1 + 2 + 3"></p>

<p>The next line is a <code>def</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>def square(x):
    return x*x</code></pre>

<p>Here, we are just <em>defining</em> a function -- we are <strong>not</strong> <em>calling</em>
the function. That makes sense; when you type in a <code>def</code> statement to
an interpreter, you don't execute the body of the function right away
(e.g. when you define <code>square</code>, you don't immediately calculate
<code>x*x</code>). Instead, we just make a <strong>binding</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="public/img/environments/def-square.png" alt="def square(x):"></p>

<p>The variable is <code>square</code>, and the value is an arrow pointing to a
function object. Notice the <em>function object</em> also says <code>square</code> --
this is called its <strong>intrinsic name</strong>, and is a separate entity from
the <em>variable</em> -- even though, right now, they both say <code>square</code>, they
are distinct.</p>

<h3>Function calls</h3>

<p>So far, we've only dealt with bindings, such as variable assignments
and <code>def</code> statements. Now, we will draw <strong>function calls</strong>. An example
of a function call is <code>square(y)</code>. There are five simple steps:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>. If an operand is itself a function call,
  apply this procedure to it</li>
  <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong>. Label it with the following:
  
  <ol>
    <li>the function's <strong>intrinsic name</strong> at the top of the frame</li>
    <li>the frame's <strong>parent</strong> (the frame in which the function was
    defined), in the top-right corner. If the parent is Global, you
    don't have to write anything</li>
    <li>a <strong>frame number</strong> in the top-left corner -- this is only
    needed if there are nested functions.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. In step 1, you already evaluated and
  simplified the operands. Now you you just have to bind variables to
  those values.</li>
  <li><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. Depending on what you see,
  you'll be drawing more bindings or drawing new frames.</li>
  <li><strong>Write the return value in the frame</strong>. If the function doesn't
  return anything, write its return value as <code>None</code>.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Let's try the first function call in the example:</p>

<pre><code>square(y)</code></pre>


<ol>
  <li><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>: the only operand is <code>y</code>. Since our
  current frame is still Global, we start looking in Global for the
  value of <code>y</code>, which is <code>6</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong>.
  
  <ol>
    <li>The <strong>intrinsic name</strong> of the function is <code>square</code> (we know
    this from the <em>function object</em> on the right-hand side)</li>
    <li>Since the parent is Global, we don't need to label the parent</li>
    <li>Since <code>square</code> won't have any nested functions, we don't need
    to label the frame with a number</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>: looking at the <code>square</code> function
  object, we see it has one formal parameter, called <code>x</code>. In step 1,
  we evaluated the corresponding operand to have a value of <code>6</code>. Now
  we draw the binding:</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/square-y.png" alt="square(y)"></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. The body of <code>square</code> just
  says <code>return x*x</code>. There are no bindings and no function calls, so
  just compute <code>x*x</code>.</p>
  
  <p>Notice that this <code>x</code> is different than the one in Global. The <code>x</code>
  in <code>square</code> is called a <strong>local variable</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong> (which is <code>6*6 = 36</code>):</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/return-x-times-x.png" alt="<code>return x*x</code>"></p></li>
</ol>

<p>And that's it! Once we're done with the function call, we exit the
frame, and our current frame becomes Global once more.</p>

<h3>Additional rules</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Don't draw frames for built-in functions like <code>add</code>, <code>mul</code>, <code>print</code>,
  etc.</li>
  <li>Variables should never have other variables as values</li>
</ul>

<h2>Variable lookup</h2>
When the looking up a variable, we always start looking in the current
frame. If that variable cannot be found there, we look in the frame's
parent next. If the variable still cannot be found, we look in the
parent's parent, and so on.

<p>If we reach Global and still can't find the variable, Python raises a
<code>NameError</code> and complains that the variable can't be found.</p>

<p>In procedural form:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Look in the current frame</strong>.</li>
  <li>If not found, <strong>recursively look in the parent frame</strong>.</li>
  <li>If there is no parent, <strong>Error</strong>.</li>
</ol></p>

<h2>More complicated examples</h2>
<h3>Function calls in function bodies</h3>

<p>Consider this code:</p>

<pre><code>x = 3

def square(x):
    return x*x

def double(x):
    return square(x+1) - square(x) - 1

double(x)</code></pre>

<p>For this problem, focus on the calls to <code>square</code> -- how many frames
for <code>square</code> do we draw? What are the parents for those frames?</p>

<p>The first three bindings look like this:</p>

<p><img src="public/img/environments/bindings.png" alt="bindings"></p>

<p>The last line says</p>

<pre><code>double(x)</code></pre>

<p>This is a function call, so the procedure is as follows.

<ol>
  <li><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>. The operand to <code>double</code> is <code>x</code>, which is
  <code>3</code> in Global.</li>
  <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong> for <code>double</code>. <code>double</code> was defined in Global,
  so we don't need to draw a parent label.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>double</code> has one parameter <code>x</code>, which
  is bound to the operand <code>3</code>.</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/double-x.png" alt="<code>double(x)</code>"></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. <code>double</code> has one line that
  says <code>return square(x+1) - square(x) - 1</code>. We have to evaluate each
  part of this expression:
  
  <ul>
    <li><p><code>square(x+1)</code>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>. We're currently in <code>double</code>'s
      frame, so <code>x</code> is <code>3</code>. Thus, <code>x + 1 = 4</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong> for <code>square</code>. Since <code>square</code> was defined
      in Global, its parent is Global.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>square</code> has one parameter <code>x</code>,
      which is bound to <code>4</code></p>
      
      <p>  <img src="public/img/environments/square-x-plus-1.png" alt="<code>square(x+1)</code>"></p></li>
      <li><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. <code>square</code> computes <code>x*x</code>,
      which is <code>16</code>.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>, which is <code>16</code>.</p>
      
      <p>  <img src="public/img/environments/return-x-times-x3.png" alt="<code>return x*x</code>"></p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
    <li><p><code>square(x)</code>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>. We're back in <code>double</code>'s
      frame, so <code>x</code> is <code>3</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong> for <code>square</code>. Since <code>square</code> was defined
      in Global, its parent is Global.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>square</code> has one parameter <code>x</code>,
      which is bound to <code>3</code></p>
      
      <p>   <img src="public/img/environments/square-x.png" alt="<code>square(x)</code>"></p></li>
      <li><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. <code>square</code> computes <code>x*x</code>,
      which is <code>9</code>.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>, which is <code>9</code>.</p>
      
      <p>   <img src="public/img/environments/return-x-times-x4.png" alt="<code>return x*x</code>"></p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <p>Now that we know <code>square(x+1)</code> is <code>16</code> and <code>square(x)</code> is <code>9</code>, we
  can compute the original expression to get <code>16 - 9 - 1 = 6</code></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong> of <code>double</code>, which is <code>6</code>.</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/double-return.png" alt="<code>return square(x + 1) - square(x) - 1</code>"></p></li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Function calls as operands</h3>

<p>Consider this code:</p>

<pre><code>x = 3

def square(x):
    return x*x

def double(x):
    ans = x + x
    return ans

square(double(x))</code></pre>

<p>Try drawing it on your own first by following the steps illustrated
above!</p>

<p>The first three bindings look like this:</p>

<p><img src="public/img/environments/bindings.png" alt="bindings"></p>

<p>Now for the hard part:</p>

<pre><code>square(double(x))</code></pre>

<p>This is a function call. Notice that the operand for <code>square</code> is
itself a function call! Should you draw the frame for <code>square</code> first
or <code>double</code>? The procedure is as follows:

<ol>
  <li><p><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>. The operand of <code>square</code> is
  <code>double(x)</code>, which is itself a function call:
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>. The operand of <code>double</code> is <code>x</code>.
    Since we're in Global, the value of <code>x</code> is <code>3</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong> for <code>double</code>.</li>
    <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>double</code>'s only parameter is
    <code>x</code>, and its operand is <code>3</code>, so bind <code>x</code> to <code>3</code> in the new
    frame. Your diagram should look like this now:</p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/double-x.png" alt="<code>double(x)</code>"></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>The first line binds <code>ans = x + x</code>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Evaluate the value</strong>: <code>x + x</code> is <code>3 + 3</code>, so the
      value is <code>6</code></li>
      <li><strong>Draw a box with the value</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Write the variable</strong>, which is <code>ans</code></li>
    </ol></p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/ans-equals-x-plus-x.png" alt="<code>ans = x + x</code>"></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>. The return value is <code>ans</code>,
    which is <code>6</code>.</p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/return-ans.png" alt="<code>return ans</code>"></p></li>
  </ol></p></li>
  <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong> for <code>square</code></li>
  <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. We saw in step 1 that <code>double(x)</code>
  is <code>6</code>. <code>square</code> has a single parameter called <code>x</code>, so we bind
  <code>x</code> to <code>6</code> in the new frame for <code>square</code></p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/square-double-x.png" alt="<code>square(double(x))</code>"></p></li>
  <li><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. <code>square</code> just says
  <code>return x*x</code>. Since <code>x</code> is <code>6</code>, <code>x*x = 36</code></li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>, which is <code>36</code></p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/return-x-times-x2.png" alt="<code>return x*x</code>"></p></li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Reassigning functions</h3>

<p>In Python, it is possible to reassign a function to something else.
Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>def foo():
    return 10

def bar():
    return 20

bar = foo
bar()</code></pre>

<p>Before drawing the diagram, try to predict what the last line
evaluates to. If you got 10, you are correct! Let's see why, by
drawing the diagram. The <code>def</code> statements are drawn as follows:</p>

<p><img src="public/img/environments/bindings3.png" alt="bindings"></p>

<p>The next line is the function reassignment:</p>

<pre><code>bar = foo</code></pre>

<p>Once again, we follow the rules for bindings:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Evaluate the value</strong>. <code>foo</code> points to a function object with
  intrinsic name <code>foo</code>, so that's our value</li>
  <li><strong>Draw the value in a box</strong>. Since we are reassigning <code>bar</code>, we
  just re-use <code>bar</code>'s existing box -- erase its old value and replace
  it with an arrow pointing to the <code>foo</code> function.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the variable</strong>. <code>bar</code> is already written.</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/bar-equals-foo.png" alt="bar = foo"></p></li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: in the picture, the <code>bar</code> function disappears, but you don't
have to erase it from your diagram.</p>

<p>The final line is</p>

<pre><code>bar()</code></pre>

<p>This is a function call, so we follow the corresponding procedure:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>. There are no operands.</li>
  <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong>. Notice that we are calling the function
  object with intrinsic name <code>foo</code>, so that's what we label the frame
  (don't label it <code>bar</code>!)</li>
  <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>foo</code> has no parameters.</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/bar.png" alt="bar()"></p></li>
  <li><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. It just returns <code>10</code></li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/return-10.png" alt="return 20"></p></li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Nested functions</h3>

<p>Up until now, we haven't had to draw the parent and frame numbers for
frames. That's because we haven't had any nested function definitions
yet.</p>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>def outer(x):
    def inner(y):
        return x + y
    return inner

fn = outer(2)
fn(3)</code></pre>

<p>The first binding (for defining <code>outer</code>) looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="public/img/environments/bindings2.png" alt="def outer(x):"></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: we haven't drawn a binding for <code>inner</code> yet! That's because
<code>inner</code> is defined in the body of <code>outer</code>, and we don't execute the
body of <code>outer</code> when we're just defining it.</p>

<p>The next line is</p>

<pre><code>fn = outer(2)</code></pre>

<p>This is a variable assignment, so we follow the procedure for
bindings:

<ol>
  <li><p><strong>Evaluate the value</strong>. The right-hand side of the <code>=</code> is a
  function call, so we have to evaluate it
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Evaluate the operands</strong>. The operand to <code>outer</code> is just <code>2</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong> for <code>outer</code>. Since it's defined in Global,
    we don't need to label the parent. We DO need to write a <strong>frame
    number</strong>, since we'll be defining a new function object. Label
    this frame <code>f1</code>.</li>
    <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>outer</code> has one paramter <code>x</code> that is
    bound to <code>2</code></p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/outer-2.png" alt="fn = outer(2)"></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. The first thing in <code>outer</code>
    is a <code>def</code> statement, so we follow the rules for bindings:
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Evaluate the value</strong>. Since it's a <code>def</code> statement, the
      value is a <em>function object</em> with an intrinsic name of
      <code>inner</code>. Also, since <code>inner</code> is defined in <code>outer</code></li>
      <li><strong>Draw the value in the box</strong>. Since a function is not a
      primitive, we need to draw an arrow to the function object</li>
      <li><p><strong>Write the variable</strong>, which is <code>inner</code>.</p>
      
      <p><img src="public/img/environments/def-inner.png" alt="def inner(y)"></p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>. <code>inner</code> points to a function object,
    so the return value points to what <code>inner</code> points to.</p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/return-inner.png" alt="return inner"></p></li>
  </ol></p></li>
  <li><strong>Draw a box with the value</strong>. Since the value is a function
  object, we draw an arrow pointing to that function object</li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the variable</strong>, which is <code>fn</code>.</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/fn-equals.png" alt="fn = outer(2)"></p></li>
</ol></p>

<p>The next line is</p>

<pre><code>fn(3)</code></pre>

<p>This is a function call:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Evalute the operands</strong>. The operand is just 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong>. <code>fn</code> points to a function whose <strong>intrinsic
  name</strong> is <code>inner</code>, so that's the label we give the frame. Also,
  since <code>inner</code> was defined in frame <code>f1</code>, we need to put the
  <strong>parent</strong> label as well.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>inner</code> has one parameter <code>y</code>, which is
  bound to 3.</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/fn-3.png" alt="fn(3)"></p></li>
  <li><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. <code>inner</code> just says <code>return x +
  y</code>. It gets a little tricky, though. Currently, we're in the frame
  for <code>inner</code>, but there's no binding for <code>x</code> in that frame! Where do
  we look next? <strong>We look in f1, the parent of inner</strong>. In <code>f1</code>,
  there is a variable <code>x</code> bound to <code>2</code>, so that's the value we'll
  use.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>, which is <code>2 + 3 = 5</code>.</p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/return-x-plus-y.png" alt="return x + y"></p></li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Built-in functions</h3>

<p>Recall that when we call built-in functions, we do not draw new
frames. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>def square1(x):
    return x*x

def square2(x):
    print(x*x)

a = square1(4)
b = square2(4)</code></pre>

<p>In the example, <code>print</code> is the built-in function. This example also
demonstrates the difference between <code>print</code> and <code>return</code>.</p>

<p>The function findings are as follows:</p>

<p><img src="public/img/environments/bindings4.png" alt="bindings"></p>

<p>The next line is</p>

<pre><code>a = square1(4)</code></pre>

<p>which is a binding. This should be straightforward by now:

<ol>
  <li><p><strong>Evaluate the value</strong>. The value is a function call, <code>square1(4)</code>:
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Evalute the operands</strong>. The operand is 4</li>
    <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong> for <code>square1</code>.</li>
    <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>square1</code> has a single paramter
    <code>x</code>, which is bound to <code>4</code>.</p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/square1-4.png" alt="square1(4)"></p></li>
    <li><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. <code>x</code> is bound to <code>4</code>, so
    <code>x*x = 16</code>.</li>
    <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>, which is 16.</p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/return-x-times-x5.png" alt="<code>return x*x</code>"></p></li>
  </ol></p></li>
  <li><strong>Draw a box with the value</strong>. We're back in Global, so that's
  where we put the value <code>16</code>.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the variable</strong>, which is <code>a</code></p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/a-equals.png" alt="a = square1(4)"></p></li>
</ol></p>

<p>And thus, <code>a</code> is bound to <code>16</code>. Nothing new here.</p>

<p>The next line is</p>

<pre><code>a = square1(4)</code></pre>

<p>The procedure is as follows:

<ol>
  <li><p><strong>Evaluate the value</strong>. The value is a function call, <code>square2(4)</code>:
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Evalute the operands</strong>. The operand is 4</li>
    <li><strong>Draw a new frame</strong> for <code>square1</code>.</li>
    <li><p><strong>Bind formal parameters</strong>. <code>square1</code> has a single paramter
    <code>x</code>, which is bound to <code>4</code>.</p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/square2-4.png" alt="square2(4)"></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Execute the body of the function</strong>. Here, the line is to
    <code>print(x*x)</code>. This <strong>is a function call</strong>, but <code>print</code> is a
    built-in function, so we do NOT draw a new frame for it.</p>
    
    <p>Also recall that the return value of <code>print</code> is always <code>None</code>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Write the return value</strong>. Since there's no <code>return</code>
    statement, the <code>square2</code> implicitly returns <code>None</code>.</p>
    
    <p><img src="public/img/environments/print-x-times-x.png" alt="<code>print(x*x)</code>"></p></li>
  </ol></p></li>
  <li><strong>Draw a box with the value</strong>. We're back in Global, so that's
  where we put the value <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Write the variable</strong>, which is <code>b</code></p>
  
  <p><img src="public/img/environments/b-equals.png" alt="b = square2(4)"></p></li>
</ol></p>

<p>Notice that <code>b</code> is bound to <code>None</code>, not 16 -- that's the difference
between <code>return</code> and <code>print</code>!</p>
